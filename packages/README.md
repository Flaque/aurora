# packages

Aurora is a project built of several packages. This is where they live.

You can create a new package template with [plop](https://github.com/amwmedia/plop)!

Just run `npm run plop` and select `package`.

## Rules 
Packages must follow the following rules:

1. Packages must contain their own `package.json`.
2. Packages must start with `aurora-`.
