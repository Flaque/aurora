# plops

The plops folder contains code generation tools. It uses [plop](https://github.com/amwmedia/plop) to create new modules if you would like.

You can globally install plop with:
``` bash
$ npm install -g plop
```

Then, you can run `$ plop` to create new modules.

Or, if you would prefer, you can use `npm run plop` to use the locally installed version.
