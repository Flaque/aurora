# Aurora 

Aurora is a project in construction. Please come back later.

## Dev Scripts

Aurora comes with a few tools that make developing it much nicer. 

All scripts can be run with `npm run <script_name_here>`.

### fmt
You can format with the default [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) formating with `npm run fmt`.

### lint
You can check your code with our projects default [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) rules with `npm run lint`. If you're new to javascript, I would recommend running this frequently. I've put in some rules that catch potential errors that tend to sneak up on newbie devs.
